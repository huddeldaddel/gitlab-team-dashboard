# GitLab Team Dashboard

The idea of this project is to build a simple dashboard that displays data about one specific GitLab group.
The application is designed to access the GitLab API from the browser - and to keep data in the browser. 
No backend, no complicated deployment - just a couple of static web pages.

The project is in very early stage. Let's see what happens.
